## 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
Learning how to use pointers and arrays and also writing some functions that use them

### 0-reset_to_98.c
> A function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
> * Prototype: ```void reset_to_98(int *n);```

### 1-swap.c
> A function that swaps the values of two integers.
> * Prototype: ```void swap_int(int *a, int *b);```

### 2-strlen.c
> A function that returns the length of a string similar to the standard libarary's ```strlen```.
> * Prototype: ```int _strlen(char *s);```

### 3-puts.c
> A function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout similar to the standard libarary's ```puts```..
> * Prototype: ```void _puts(char *str);```

### 4-print_rev.c
> A function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
> * Prototype: ```void print_rev(char *s);```

### 5-rev_string.c
> A function that reverses a string.
> * Prototype: ```void rev_string(char *s);```

### 6-puts2.c
> A function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.
> * Prototype: ```void puts2(char *str);```

### 7-puts_half.c
> A function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line.
> * Prototype: ```void puts_half(char *str);```
> * The function should print the second half of the string
> * If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string,  
> where ```n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2```

### 8-print_array.c
> A function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
> * Prototype: ```void print_array(int *a, int n);```
> * where ```n``` is the number of elements of the array to be printed
> * Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space
> * The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array
> * You are allowed to use ```printf```

### 9-strcpy.c
> A function that copies the string pointed to by ```src```,  
> including the terminating null byte (```\0```), to the buffer pointed to by ```dest```,  
> Similar to the standard library's ```strcpy```
> * Prototype: ```char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);```
> * Return value: the pointer to ```dest```
