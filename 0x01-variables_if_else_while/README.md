Learning about C control functions like if, while, for and do while.

### 0-positive_or_negative.c
> This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and  
>  print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
> The output of the program should be:
> * The number, followed by
>   * if the number is greater than 0: is positive
>   * if the number is 0: is zero
>   * if the number is less than 0: is negative
> *followed by a new line


### 1-last_digit.c
> This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed and  
>  print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
> The output of the program should be:
> * The string Last digit of, followed by
> * n, followed by
> * the string is, followed by
>   * if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
>   * if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
>   * if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
> * followed by a new line

### 2-print_alphabet.c
